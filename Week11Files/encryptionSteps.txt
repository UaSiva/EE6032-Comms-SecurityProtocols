**This protocol assumes that a unique session key has been established between the server and
  each client which connects to it. This ensures data encryption on all sockets.

  

In order for transmitted messages to be encrypted the following protocol should be followed:

1 - The client encrypts all messages that it sends to server using pyNaCl i.e encrypt(msg)

2 - The server receives messages in handle_client() and decrypts them with that specific
    clients session key i.e decrypt(msg)

3 - The server then broadcasts the message to all clients. Server must ensure that the message 
    being broadcast is encrpyted using the correct session key for each client it is broadcasting
    to.

4 - The client receives messages, decrypts them using its session key and adds the decrypted
    message to the message list on the GUI.
