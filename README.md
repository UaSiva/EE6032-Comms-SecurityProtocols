# EE6032-Comms-SecurityProtocols
A repository for the EE6032 module project, a secure chat application, similar to WhatsApp

First Deadline: Friday, Week 7
 -> Have a functioning client/server chat application running, either locally or between machines.
 
 -> The application also needs to have functionality to send files e.g image > 100KB
 
 -> There should be a simple GUI, similar to WhatsApp - including an area to display messages, an input box to type messages, a send button and a file upload button.
 
 -> The security algorithms also need to be understood, but not implemented yet.
